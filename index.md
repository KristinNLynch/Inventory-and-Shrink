<h1>Inventory and Shrink</h1>

This project show methods for measuring and analyzing inventory loss. This page is still a work in progress while I work on the write up for the project. 


<h2> Outline of Steps </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Review Git hub and git</li>
  <li> Find data online, document source </li>
    <p>I used Kaggle to try to find a data source of POS data that would work for this project. There were various data sources that had sales transactions, but I couldn't find one that had everything I needed.  </p>
  --Link to the data source--
  <li> Clean up / format and identify issues in data </li>
 <p> I wanted a csv file that would be over 100K in records, so I downloaded from this source, then added additional fields and generated random data to fill them. I did some clean up and analysis in excel to make sure that it could work for this analysis. </p>
  <li> Use Python to do the data cleansing and formating </li>
  <li> Use Python or R to do the analysis - create baselines and compare issues </li>
  <li> Do analysis on the data </li>
  <li> Depending on data available, create a dashboard on tableau to embed </li>
  <li> Write about findings </li>
  <li> Update HTML and format of Pages </li>
  </ol>
